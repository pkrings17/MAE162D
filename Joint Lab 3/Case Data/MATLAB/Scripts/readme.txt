The MATLAB scripts were used to process the data from the .mat objects:
  lab3_plots.m - loads all general trajectory data objects and plots the desired data (inputs, paths, sensor outputs, errors)
  slip_analysis.m - loads slip data objects and plots desired data
  noise_analysis.m - loads noise data objects and plots desired data
  lidar_calc.m - used to derive the analytical LIDAR output from the analytical data
